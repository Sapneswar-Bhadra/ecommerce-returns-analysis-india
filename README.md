# Reducing E-Commerce Returns in India

## Problem Statement
Indian e-commerce companies face high order returns, cancellations, and delivery rejections, especially for Cash on Delivery (COD) and long-distance shipments. These failures increase logistics cost and reduce profitability.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer, order, and delivery data to identify the key drivers of returns and propose a data-driven strategy to reduce losses.

## Dataset
This project uses a synthetic, India-based e-commerce dataset created for analytical purposes.  
The dataset includes:
- Customers
- Products
- Orders
- Delivery details

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, analysis, pivot tables)
- GitHub (project versioning and portfolio presentation)


## Key Analysis
- Created return flags to identify failed orders
- Compared COD vs prepaid payment methods
- Analyzed return rates across delivery distance buckets
- Segmented orders into high-risk and low-risk categories

## Business Solution
Designed a 100 km discount-based redistribution strategy where returned or high-risk orders are offered to nearby customers with a 10–20% discount to reduce logistics losses and improve profit recovery.

## Key Insights
- COD orders show significantly higher return rates than prepaid orders
- Orders delivered beyond 100 km have higher rejection and return rates
- Risk-based order segmentation enables targeted intervention
